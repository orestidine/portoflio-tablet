            <p>Lionel Andres Cuccitini Messi was born on June 24th, 1987 in Rosario, Sante Fe, Argentina. He developed
            an interest for soccer at an early age, joining local club Grandoli at the age of four which was coached
            by his father. At six years old, he joined the youth team for Newell's Old Boys. A club which he is still a 
            supporter of. Messi was unfortunately diagnosed with Growth Hormone Deficiency when he was 10 years old.
            This condition out his athletic career at risk. The treatment would be costly and club teams in Argetina
            were not able to help him pay for the treatment. Fortunately for young Lionel, scouts
            for famous spanish soccer club Fc Barceloan took notice of his talent. He signed for Fc Barcelona's youth team in late
            2000 at the age of 13. After he would quickly go through the ranks and dominate at youth level before finally
            making it to the professional senior team.

            <p>Messi made his professional debut for the senior team on October 16th, 2004 against local rivals Espanyol.
           He went on to be fully promoted for the first team in the 2005/2006 season. Messi quickly gained stardom
           and praise in his early career. Being considered by many as one of the best young talents in the world and even
           drawing comparisons with Argentinian soccer legend Diego Maradona who was considered by many to be the greatest soccer
           player ever. Messi produced one of the most iconic performances by scoring a hat trick against heated rival team Real Madrid
           at just the age of 19. This performance gained worldwide attention and further increased the hype around his career.
           Messi went on to have a fantastic club career with multiple trophies and records. Winning a Champions League Final in 2009 by scoring the winning goal with
           his head to secure a 2-0 win for Barcelona against Manchester United. He became Fc Barcelona's top all time official scorer in
           2012 by surpassing the previous record of 232 goals. He now currently has 672. Messi won 4 Champions Leagues,
           10 La Liga's, 7 Copa del Rey's, 8 Spanish Supercups's, 3 Uefa Super Cups, and 3 Club World Cups before leaving the club

            <p>Messi's professional international career with Argentina started in 2005 when he made his debut against Hungary.
           Although Messi performed at a great level with Argentina as he did at club level, the team success was not as good
           as it was with Fc Barcelona. For many years Argentina struggled as a team and drew many criticism from fans and media.
           They reached the final for the 2007 Copa America tournament but lost the final to rivals Brazil 3-0. Messi won the award
           for best young player at age 20. Messi's Argentina lost an additional 3 finals in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Messi scored 4 goals
           and won the best player of the tournament award for his performances in the 2014 world cup but lost the final to Germany in extra time
           1-0. After losing the Copa America final in 2016, Messi made the shocking decison to retire from the national team after
           three heartbreaks in a row. However, he quickly reversed his decision about a month and a half later in August. 
           Argentina were struggling to even qualify for the world cup following bad results in 2016 and 2017. On the final matchday
           of world cup qualifications, Messi scored a hat trick after his team were down 1-0 against Ecuador in a must win game.
           Argentina qualified for the World Cup and Messi was praised as a hero. Eventually, after still chasing a trophy with
           the national team, Messi finally won the 2021 Copa America. He won the award for Best Player, was the top scorer and 
           top assister of the tournament. Messi is seen as a legend and hero for Argentina. He broke the record for most goals
           for the Argentinian national team in 2016 against United States, scoring his 55th goal off a free kick. Messi currently
           has 80 goals for Argentina.
